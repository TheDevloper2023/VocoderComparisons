`Disclaimer : This repo is build for testing purpose. The code is not optimized for performance.`
## Training :
```
python train.py --config config_v1.json
```

## Note:
* We are able to get good quality of audio with 30 % less training compared to original hifigan.
* This model approx 60 % faster than counterpart hifigan.
