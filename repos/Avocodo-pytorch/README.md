> **Disclaimer:** It only works on config_v1.json for now and this repo build with experimentation purpose not for Production.
- **For best quality speech synthesis please visit [deepsync.co](https://deepsync.co/)**
## Training:
```
python train.py --config config_v1.json
```


## Notes:
* Avocodo uses same Generator as HiFi-GAN V1 and V2 but using different discriminators for modelling better lower and higher frequencies.
* PQMF is the crucial for both Discriminators.
* Losses are similar to HiFi-GAN.
* Performance and speed both are some what similar to HiFi-GAN.
* Avocodo far better than HiFi-GAN when it comes to synthesize unseen speaker.
* **Avocodo training is around 20 % faster than HiFi-GAN also it took very less training to output excellent quality of audio.**
